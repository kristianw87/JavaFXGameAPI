# JavaFXGameAPI

2D game api for JavaFX and fxml in combination with SceneBuilder
This framework uses JBox2D as a physics engine, and supports the bodies, fixtures and shapes functionality from JBox2D. Joints functionality is not yet supported.

Includes demo games of Pong, Breakout, Asteroids and a 2D-platform game Jetpack
This API was written as a prototype for a master thesis at NTNU
